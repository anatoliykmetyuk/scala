  /*
   * handleContinuation:
   *
   * The most complicated method of the Script Executor:
   * determine what an N-ary operator will do
   * after it has received a set of messages. Potential outcomes include:
   * - activate next operand and/or have success
   * - suspend, resume, exclude
   * - deactivate
   * - nothing
   *
   * The decision is based on three aspects:
   * - the kind of operator
   * - the state of the node
   * - the received messages
   * 
   * The main complication is due to the existence of the optional break operand (".").
   * For sequential composition this is relatively easy, as the optional break causes
   * the sequential operator to succeed itself, and also to activate the next operand.
   * For parallel operators and the semi-parallel disrupt operator ("/") the optional break
   * is really complicated (as it seems at least for now); 
   * more information follows below.
   * 
   * Note that the "loop with optional break" operand ".." is essentially a "." combined with a "...".
   * The effect of the latter is rather simple, as it makes the current n_ary_operator a loop, 
   * as if its template subtree is repeated infinitely many times 
   * (only with the pass counter being incremented)
   * 
   * Note that the disrupt operator ("/") behaves just like "|" except for exclusion:
   * - when an atomic action happens in an operand, all operands more to the left are excluded
   * - when an operand deactivates successfully then all operands more to the right are excluded
   * 
   * The rest of this comment is rather long, probably too long; 
   * FTTB it is left here until something better and more concise is available
   * 

On activation all n-ary operators activate their leftmost operands.
Moreover, a “continuation” message is inserted into the message queue,
so that, as soon as the just instigated activation of a subtree has ended,
the next operand may start activating, and so on, until no new activations are needed.

For a sequential operator (“;”) a next operand is activated when its predecessor
operand has success; if there is no such a next operand, then the sequential
operator itself succeeds. The latter also happens when an operand has an optional-break.

For the exclusive-or operator, the behaviour of “.” is different;
as only in 1 operand of this “+” operator an atomic action may happen,
the only sensible meaning for the optional break is: only activate the
next operand if just before an atomic action has been activated.
The meaning of “just before” needs clarification.
These are the operands activated since after the previous optional-break operand,
or from the start if there is no such previous optional-break operand.
If there were no such “just before” operands, as in . + x and in x + . + .
for the second optional-break, then keep on activating
(an alternative definition, not necessarily worse, would be: stop activation).

For parallel operators and for the disruption operator the behaviour is
more difficult, especially for those that are and-like. Note that for an
or-like n-ary operator have success, it is enough for any of its operands
to have a recent success. A success of an operand is recent if after it
has happened no atomic action it its subtree has happened.
An and-like parallel operator has in principle success when all its operands
have success, but the optional break complicates matters.
E.g. in x&.&y, the optional break says that y is optional;
as long as no atomic action inside y has happened, the success
of & depends on the x operand.
Another effect of “.” here is that y only should be activated
as soon as at least one atomic action inside x has happened;
maybe it would be good to add here another possibility:
no atomic actions inside x have been activated.

To define "more precisely" when “next activations” of parallel operators
happen, we consider their templates to be of the form

xi & . & yi & . & zi

Here xi etc stand for groups of operands that have no optional-breaks
activated; each group size is 0 or higher.
& stands here for any operator of: & && | || /

On activation xi and “.” activate.
Activation continues with the next group (yi) if no atomic actions in xi have been activated.
Then when in this continuation again no atomic actions have been activated, zi is activated, etc.

In other cases, so when in a group atomic actions had been activated,
then the next group is activated shortly after for the first time in
the previous group an atomic action has happened. 

For the determination of successfulness of a parallel operator
such a newly activated group, of which no atomic actions have happened,
does not count. Let's call such a group an "optional group".
Note that for parallel operators not only the successfulness of the current operands is relevant,
but also of the past operands. 
E.g. a past operand of & that has deactivated without recent success
is a failure, and it prevents & from ever having success.
Likewise a past operand of | that has deactivated with a recent success makes sure that
| has a success after each atomic action happening somewhere in the descendant subtree of |.
These effects do not hold when the operand is in an optional group.
